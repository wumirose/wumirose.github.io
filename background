## 💡 Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach is grounded in three principles:
1. **Relevance drives engagement** — connect theory to real-world impact.  
2. **Inclusion requires intentional design** — multiple entry points for diverse learners.  
3. **Productive struggle builds confidence** — scaffold challenges to support growth.
