## Teaching Philosophy

  My teaching approach is grounded in three principles:
    1. **Relevance drives engagement** — connect theory to real-world impact.  
    2. **Inclusion requires intentional design** — multiple entry points for diverse learners.  
    3. **Productive struggle builds confidence** — scaffold challenges to support growth.
